# Microsoft Security Querries
## Advanced Threat Hunt
In order to identify the infected devices by a specific CVE we can use the following querry :
```kql
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| where CveId == "CVE-2024-6387"
| project DeviceId, DeviceName, OSPlatform, OSVersion, OSArchitecture, SoftwareVendor, CveMitigationStatus
```
### Detailed Threat Hunt

This KQL (Kusto Query Language) query is designed to identify devices that are vulnerable to a specific CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) ID, based on their association with critical identities within a network. The query consists of three main parts: defining critical identities, identifying critical devices associated with these identities, and filtering for devices vulnerable to a specific CVE. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

#### 1. Defining Critical Identities

```kql
let CriticalIdentities = 
    ExposureGraphNodes
    | where set_has_element(Categories, "identity")
    | where isnotnull(NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel) and NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel.criticalityLevel < 4 
    | distinct NodeName;
```

- **ExposureGraphNodes**: This table contains information about various nodes in the exposure graph, such as users, devices, or other entities.
- **where set_has_element(Categories, "identity")**: Filters the nodes to include only those categorized as "identity".
- **where isnotnull(NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel) and NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel.criticalityLevel < 4**: Further filters the identities to include only those with a defined criticality level that is less than 4 (assuming a scale where lower numbers indicate higher criticality).
- **distinct NodeName**: Selects unique node names that meet the above criteria, resulting in a set of critical identities.
---
#### 2. Identifying Critical Devices

```kql
let CriticalDevices = 
    ExposureGraphEdges 
    | where EdgeLabel == @"can authenticate to"
    | join ExposureGraphNodes on $left.TargetNodeId==$right.NodeId
    | extend DName = tostring(NodeProperties.rawData.deviceName)
    | extend isLocalAdmin = EdgeProperties.rawData.userRightsOnDevice.isLocalAdmin
    | where SourceNodeName has_any (CriticalIdentities)
    | distinct DName;
```

- **ExposureGraphEdges**: This table contains information about relationships (edges) between nodes in the exposure graph.
- **where EdgeLabel == @"can authenticate to"**: Filters the edges to include only those where the relationship type is "can authenticate to", indicating that one node (identity) can authenticate to another node (device).
- **join ExposureGraphNodes on $left.TargetNodeId==$right.NodeId**: Joins the edges with the nodes to get additional properties of the target nodes (devices).
- **extend DName = tostring(NodeProperties.rawData.deviceName)**: Extracts the device name from the node properties.
- **extend isLocalAdmin = EdgeProperties.rawData.userRightsOnDevice.isLocalAdmin**: Extracts whether the identity has local admin rights on the device.
- **where SourceNodeName has_any (CriticalIdentities)**: Filters to include only edges where the source node name is one of the critical identities identified earlier.
- **distinct DName**: Selects unique device names associated with these critical identities.

#### 3. Filtering for Vulnerable Devices

```kql
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities 
| where CveId == "CVE-2024-38021"
| where DeviceName has_any (CriticalDevices)
```

- **DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities**: This table contains information about software vulnerabilities on devices.
- **where CveId == "CVE-2024-38021"**: Filters the table to include only records related to the specific CVE ID "CVE-2024-38021".
- **where DeviceName has_any (CriticalDevices)**: Further filters to include only devices that are in the list of critical devices identified earlier.

#### 4. Final Querry
```kql
let CriticalIdentities =
ExposureGraphNodes
| where set_has_element(Categories, "identity")
| where isnotnull(NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel) and
NodeProperties.rawData.criticalityLevel.criticalityLevel < 4 
| distinct NodeName;
let CriticalDevices =
ExposureGraphEdges 
| where EdgeLabel == @"can authenticate to"
| join ExposureGraphNodes on $left.TargetNodeId==$right.NodeId
| extend DName = tostring(NodeProperties.rawData.deviceName)
| extend isLocalAdmin = EdgeProperties.rawData.userRightsOnDevice.isLocalAdmin
| where SourceNodeName has_any (CriticalIdentities)
| distinct DName;
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities 
| where CveId == "CVE-2024-38021"
| where DeviceName has_any (CriticalDevices)
```
